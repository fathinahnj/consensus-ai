# Role and Limitation of AI Facilitator in Political Consensus Formation using Agent-Based Simulation 
This study aims to evaluate the role and limitations of AI facilitator agents in improving the quality of digital deliberative democracy, using an agent-based modeling approach. In this study, we use Indonesian Electoral Voting (Pemilihan Umum Calon Presiden & Wakil Presiden) 2024 as a case study.

* Positioning of the Study


### I. Research Objectives

Specifically, this study analyzes whether the presence of AI facilitators in public discussions can:

* Reduce the level of opinion polarization between voter groups,

* Reduce the dominance of elite actors in the deliberation process,

* Without eliminating the diversity of opinion that is a prerequisite for democracy.

The model does not start from the assumption that *AI is always effective*, but rather examines the **structural and psychological conditions** under which AI successfully facilitates deliberation or fails to have a significant impact.


### II. Research Questions
**AI Facilitator as a Deliberative Intervention**

The first focus is on the AI ​​facilitator as a deliberative moderation intervention, with the main question: ***can an AI facilitator agent improve the quality of political discussions without imposing artificial consensus?***

The AI ​​intervention is modeled as a specialized agent that:

* has no political preferences,
* influences the dynamics of the discussion through interaction rules (e.g., rebalancing turn-taking, cross-group exposure, or de-escalation).

The simulation results are compared between two conditions:

* without an AI facilitator
* with an AI facilitator

**Limits of AI in Digital Democracy (Critical Perspective)**

The second focus is reflective and critical, aiming to identify the limits of AI's capabilities in digital democracy. This research explicitly examines the conditions under which AI facilitators **fail**, specifically when:

* Social homophily is too high, so agents only interact with ideologically aligned groups;
* Elite dominance is too strong, so AI interventions are unable to balance influence;
* Agents' political identities are so entrenched that opinions become inert to the discussion.

Thus, this model answers not only "can AI help or not," but also "**when and why AI cannot help.**"

### III. Research Outputs
**Core Simulation Output**

* Agent-Based Model of Indonesian Electoral Voters (2024)
* Demographic heterogeneity (age, education, economics)
* Psychological and ideological variations
* Representation of elite dominance and discussion structure

**Comparison of Deliberation Dynamics**

* Without AI facilitator
* With AI facilitator

**Quantitative Metrics & Visual Outputs**
The model produces the following time series and collective metrics:
* Polarization(t)
The degree of separation of opinions between groups over time.

* Dominance(t)
The degree of concentration of discussion influence on the elite agent.

* Consensus Stability
Whether consensus (if formed) is stable or fragile to disruption.

These graphs are used to compare the effectiveness of AI interventions across different social configurations.

**Phase Diagram & Failure Mapping**

As a follow-up output, this research produced a phase diagram that shows:

* When deliberative consensus is likely to form,

* When polarization is structural and difficult to overcome,

* When AI facilitators have no significant impact.

This diagram allows for analysis across scenarios, not just a single case.

### IV. Positioning of the Study

This research is positioned as:

Not a proposal for a technocratic solution, but rather a critical, simulation-based exploration of:

* what can,

* what cannot,

* and what should not be imposed by AI in digital democracy.
